            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Adarsh Kumar jain </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Raghogarh, Guna, India.</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            My primary focus is on building robust, efficient, and user-friendly solutions across web development, automation, and DevOps.  
            <br />I believe that a great application not only looks appealing but also delivers a seamless and optimized user experience.  
            <br />With expertise in Python, PowerShell, MySQL, PHP, and a wide range of DevOps tools, Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges  
            and collaborate on projects that drive innovation and exceed expectations.  
            <br /><br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
